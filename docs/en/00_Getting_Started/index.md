title: Getting Started
introduction: SilverStripe is a web application. This means that you will need to have a webserver and database. We will take you through the setup of the server environment as well the application itself.


## Installing SilverStripe

The best way to get SilverStripe is to [install with Composer](composer). Composer is a package management tool for PHP that
lets you install and upgrade SilverStripe and its modules.  Although installing Composer is one extra step, it will give you much more flexibility than just downloading the file from silverstripe.org.

Other ways to get SilverStripe:

 * If you just want to get the code as quickly as possible, you can [download SilverStripe from our website](http://www.silverstripe.org/software/download).
 * If you already have an installed version of SilverStripe, and you haven't used Composer to get it, please see our [upgrading](/upgrading) guide.  Note that [Composer](composer) provides its own tools for upgrading.
